I'm going to publish all plugins that am gonna make. Of course i have my own life, so sometimes it can take me up to 7 days to make a plugin, depending on the difficulty. Every plugin will be open source under 
~~CC BY-SA 4.0~~ GPLv3 License. 

Why i want to make it free and opensource? Because there's a need for free good quality plugins on the market (::

There will be soon a page for searching the plugins. For now please look at repositories.
